    Parameters
    ----------
    f : function
        The function to be approximated. NOTE: Valid input is restricted to callable Python functions
        (including user-created functions) and yroots Polynomial (MultiCheb and MultiPower) objects.
        String representations of functions are not valid input.
    a: array-like or single value
        An array containing the lower bound of the approximation interval in each dimension, listed in
        dimension order
    b: array-like or single value
        An array containing the upper bound of the approximation interval in each dimension, listed in
        dimension order.
    relApproxTol : float
        The relative tolerance used to determine at what degree the Chebyshev coefficients have
        converged to zero. If all coefficients after degree n are within relApproxTol * supNorm
        (the maximum function evaluation on the interval) of zero, the coefficients will be
        considered to have converged at degree n. Defaults to 1e-10.
    
    Returns
    -------
    coefficient_matrix : numpy array
        The coefficient matrix of the Chebyshev approximation.
    error : float
        The error associated with the approximation.
