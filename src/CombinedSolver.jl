function solve(funcs,a,b; verbose = false, returnBoundingBoxes = false, exact=false, minBoundingIntervalSize=1e-5)
    """Finds and returns the roots of a system of functions on the search interval [a,b].

    Generates an approximation for each function using Chebyshev polynomials on the interval given,
    then uses properties of the approximations to shrink the search interval. When the information
    contained in the approximation is insufficient to shrink the interval further, the interval is
    subdivided into subregions, and the searching function is recursively called until it zeros in
    on each root. A specific point (and, optionally, a bounding box) is returned for each root found.

    NOTE: YRoots uses just in time compiling, which means that part of the code will not be compiled until
    a system of functions to solve is given (rather than compiling all the code upon importing the module).
    As a result, the very first time the solver is given any system of equations of a particular dimension,
    the module will take several seconds longer to solve due to compiling time. Once the first system of a
    particular dimension has run, however, other systems of that dimension (or even the same system run
    again) will be solved at the normal (faster) speed thereafter.

    NOTE: The solve function is only guaranteed to work well on systems of equations where each function
    is continuous and smooth and each root in the interval is a simple root. If a function is not
    continuous and smooth on an interval or an infinite number of roots exist in the interval, the
    solver may get stuck in recursion or the kernel may crash.

    Examples
    --------

    >>> f = lambda x,y,z: 2*x**2 / (x**4-4) - 2*x**2 + .5
    >>> g = lambda x,y,z: 2*x**2*y / (y**2+4) - 2*y + 2*x*z
    >>> h = lambda x,y,z: 2*z / (z**2-4) - 2*z
    >>> roots = yroots.solve([f, g, h], np.array([-0.5,0,-2**-2.44]), np.array([0.5,np.exp(1.1376),.8]))
    >>> print(roots)
    [[-4.46764373e-01  4.44089210e-16 -5.55111512e-17]
     [ 4.46764373e-01  4.44089210e-16 -5.55111512e-17]]
    


    >>> M1 = yroots.MultiPower(np.array([[0,3,0,2],[1.5,0,7,0],[0,0,4,-2],[0,0,0,1]]))
    >>> M2 = yroots.MultiCheb(np.array([[0.02,0.31],[-0.43,0.19],[0.06,0]]))
    >>> roots = yroots.solve([M1,M2],-5,5)
    >>> print(roots)
    [[-0.98956615 -4.12372817]
     [-0.06810064  0.03420242]]

    Parameters
    ----------
    funcs: list
        List of functions for searching. NOTE: Valid input is restricted to callable Python functions
        (including user-created functions) and yroots Polynomial (MultiCheb and MultiPower) objects.
        String representations of functions are not valid input.
    a: list or numpy array
        An array containing the lower bound of the search interval in each dimension, listed in
        dimension order. If the lower bound is to be the same in each dimension, a single float input
        is also accepted. Defaults to -1 in each dimension if no input is given.
    b: list or numpy array
        An array containing the upper bound of the search interval in each dimension, listed in
        dimension order. If the upper bound is to be the same in each dimension, a single float input
        is also accepted. Defaults to 1 in each dimension if no input is given.
    verbose : bool
        Defaults to False. Tracks progress of the approximation and rootfinding by outputting progress to
        the terminal. Useful in tracking progress of systems of equations that take a long time to solve.
    returnBoundingBoxes : bool
        Defaults to False. Whether or not to return a precise bounding box for each root.
    exact: bool
        Defaults to False. Whether transformations performed on the approximation should be performed
        with higher precision to minimize error.
    minBoundingIntervalSize : double
        Defaults to 1e-5. If a root is found with a bounding interval of size > minBoundingIntervalSize in
        each dimension, the functions are solved again on the smaller interval. Setting too small could cause
        issues if the functions can't be evaluated accurately on points close together, and will increase solve
        times. Should give more accurate roots when smaller. This number is absolute when the boudning interval in
        question is in [-1,1], and relative otherwise. So if an interval has an endpoint of magnitude > 1, then
        minBoundingIntervalSize is multipled by that value for that dimension.

    Returns
    -------
    yroots : numpy array
        A list of the roots of the system of functions on the interval.
    boundingBoxes : numpy array (optional)
        The exact intervals (boxes) in which each root is bound to lie.
